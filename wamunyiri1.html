            <p>This was one of the earliest pictures of the squad taken during its foundation. It mostly comprised of villagers. After matches, there was a tradition where the winning team could choose to really fight with the opposition - and the opposition also had to lose the fight because they had already lost the game.</p>

            <p>Training is often done together with the main team, which helps the academy players become tough, persistent, and gain experience from our senior players. The kids have competed in many competitions with excellent performances and results, recently finishing second in regional competitions.</p>
            
            <p>Nyanja (bottom picture, last line extreme right) has become an important player for the main team. The coach trusts him and utilizes him in various positions due to his versatility and experience.</p>

                <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='Image/Jimmy.jpg') }}" alt="Player Jimmy">
            </div>
            <p>James (Jimmy), at the far left in the team photos, has been with the team since its early days. A versatile player who contributes in defense, midfield, and attack, he's currently a student at Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology.</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='Image/Mike1.jpg') }}" alt="Player Mike">
            </div>
            <p>Mike (wearing short #8) progressed from our youth team to become our main box-to-box midfielder. He's currently furthering his education at college while playing for the team.</p>

                <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='Image/sany1.jpg') }}" alt="Player Sany">
            </div>
            <p>Sany joined the team at a young age and has been loyal ever since. Despite his size, he's a natural defender - perhaps the most comfortable and composed defender on the ball in the whole team. Coming from a sporting family (his father was a player and now a referee), Sany has also played upfront thanks to his ball control and finishing ability.</p>
