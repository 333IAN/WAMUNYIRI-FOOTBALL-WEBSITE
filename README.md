1. DATA COLLECTION
Data(including dates,pictures,videos e.t.c) was collected from various sources to make the website appealing to viewers.
Pictures taken from long ago contribute to the addition of data in the website.
Dates and events recorded in those pictures are also included and a brief description.

2.CODING IN HTML
Website employs Hyper Text Markup Language to engage data collected and provide you with a view of the website from login upto data inclusion.
It employs various structures such as inclusion of tables,forms paragraphs e.t.c.This simplifies the webpage and easens navigation.

3.CODING IN JAVASCRIPT
Javascript creates a dynamic and interactive behaviour in websites e.g form validation, picture sliders and website pop-ups.
Intergrating with HTML makes website more respnsive and user interactivity.

4.CSS Styling
Styling features e.g colors and text styling, box model, layout and positioning, visual effects e.t.c are employed making website appealing visually.

5.FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
Webpage is under continuous development and I plan on addition of backend programming integrating Flask and Django using Python, Java Springboot e.t.c
This shall handle logic databases, authentication and API's then sending data back webpage.
