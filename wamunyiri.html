        <h2>ACADEMY</h2>
        <p>The team also natures passionate kids from their tender age to come up with the team's tradition and hence easier to adapt to any team tactics.Many have come up from the academy and succeded in the main team e.g Nyanja.This has also encouraged more children to join the team as they aspire to be like their counterpart.</p>
        <p>Training is oftenly done together with the main team.This guides th academy to be tough,persistent and gain experience from we, the experienced.The kids have also competed in many competitions and boast of good perfomances and results.</p>
        <p>They recently finished second in the regional competitions.Winning awards like trophies,jerseys and balls.</p>
